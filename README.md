## About the Project

This repository serves as a collection of exercises designed to enhance your understanding of C# and .NET. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of programming, such as object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and algorithms. The goal is to provide practical experience through hands-on challenges.

The exercises are structured to encourage problem-solving and critical thinking. You will write C# code, run it, and see the results. This approach helps reinforce concepts and build confidence in your coding abilities.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: A modern, object-oriented programming language.
- **.NET**: A versatile framework for building applications across different platforms.
- **Visual Studio**: An integrated development environment (IDE) for C# development.
- **Git**: A version control system to manage your code.
